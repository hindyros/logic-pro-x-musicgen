# logic-pro-x-musicgen

Music generation app for music makers with a Logic Pro X–style UI. Allows you to generate tracks one at a time in a controllable way, unlike Suno.

## Roadmap
- UI mockup inspired by Logic Pro X (track list, mixer, piano roll, plugin rack)
- Track-by-track AI generation with controllable parameters
- Export stems and mixes
- Plugin host for third-party models

## Development
This repository contains a React + Vite skeleton to get started.
